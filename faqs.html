                <h3>What is a central vacuum system?</h3>
                <p>A central vacuum system is a powerful and efficient vacuum cleaner that is installed in a home or
                    building. It consists of a main unit that is typically installed in a basement or garage, and a
                    network of pipes that runs through the walls to inlets located throughout the building.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How does a central vacuum system work?</h3>
                <p>The central vacuum system works by using a motor to create suction, which is then transferred through
                    a network of pipes to a central unit. The dirt and debris are collected in a canister or bag located
                    in the central unit, which can be easily emptied when full.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What are the benefits of a central vacuum system?</h3>
                <p>Central vacuum systems offer several benefits, including more powerful suction, quieter operation
                    compared to portable vacuums, improved indoor air quality, and convenience with built-in inlets in
                    various rooms.</p>

            <br><h2>Installation and Maintenance</h2>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Can I install a central vacuum system myself?</h3>
                <p>While it is possible to install a central vacuum system yourself, it is recommended to hire a
                    professional to ensure proper installation and avoid potential issues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>How often should I maintain my central vacuum system?</h3>
                <p>Regular maintenance is important for optimal performance. It is recommended to check the filters and
                    bags every 6 to 12 months and to have the system inspected by a professional annually.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>What type of maintenance is required?</h3>
                <p>Maintenance typically involves emptying the canister or replacing the bag, cleaning or replacing
                    filters, checking for clogs in the pipes, and ensuring that the motor and other components are
                    functioning correctly.</p>
